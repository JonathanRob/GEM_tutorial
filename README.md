# GEM Tutorial

This repository contains the scripts and documentation associated with the tutorial on working with genome-scale metabolic models (GEMs) and using them to interpret -omics data in the context of metabolism.

## Exercise 1: COBRApy

Launch a Jupyter notebook session
```
$ jupyter notebook
```

From the Jupyter browser, navigate to the `scripts/` directory and open the `COBRApy_tutorial.ipynb` notebook. Follow the instructions within.


## Exercise 2: GEM-based gene set enrichment and analysis

### OPTIONAL Setup:
**Regenerates the `HumanGEM_metabolite_GSC.gmt` and `HumanGEM_subsystem_GSC.gmt` files**

Launch a Jupyter notebook session
```
$ jupyter notebook
```

From the Jupyter browser, navigate to the `scripts/` directory and open the `GEM_GSC_extraction.ipynb` notebook. Follow the instructions within.


### R Exercise

Launch RStudio from the command line
```
$ rstudio &
```

Follow the instructions found in the `GEM_GSA.html` document, located in the `scripts/` directory. Optionally, the source RMarkdown file `GEM_GSA.Rmd` can be opened within RStudio, though it is not as easy to read as the HTML.
