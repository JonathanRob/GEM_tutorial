## Startup

For this exercise, install the following:

- RAVEN Toolbox ([Installation instructions](https://github.com/SysBioChalmers/RAVEN/wiki/Installation#installation-instructions))

!!! note
    You do not need to install `libSBML` or a solver at this time.


## Loading a model

In your file browser (i.e., not in MATLAB), navigate to the `RAVEN/tutorial/` subdirectory and open the `smallYeast.xlsx` file within.

Switch through the different tabs (worksheets) to see what content is present, and how it is represented. In particular, look at the `RXNS` tab, which describes all reactions in the model. Don't worry about understanding every field at this point.
